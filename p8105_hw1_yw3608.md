# Problem 1

**First, load the tidyverse library.**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

**Next, create a dataframe which satisfy the required question**

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    score=rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=1),
gr_than_zero =score > 0,
vec_char =c("Lily","Cody","Tommy","Sally","Jack","Anna","Lucy","Coco","Jerry","Stella"),
vec_factor =factor(c("high school diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","high school diploma","postgraduate diploma","postgraduate diploma","high school diploma"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##     score gr_than_zero vec_char vec_factor          
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>        <chr>    <fct>               
    ##  1 -1.61  FALSE        Lily     high school diploma 
    ##  2  2.56  TRUE         Cody     college diploma     
    ##  3 -0.489 FALSE        Tommy    college diploma     
    ##  4 -0.119 FALSE        Sally    college diploma     
    ##  5  1.74  TRUE         Jack     college diploma     
    ##  6 -1.64  FALSE        Anna     college diploma     
    ##  7  0.888 TRUE         Lucy     high school diploma 
    ##  8  0.418 TRUE         Coco     postgraduate diploma
    ##  9  1.64  TRUE         Jerry    postgraduate diploma
    ## 10 -0.447 FALSE        Stella   high school diploma

**Next, try to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe**

``` r
mean(pull(df,score))
## [1] 0.2952127
mean(pull(df,gr_than_zero))
## [1] 0.5
mean(pull(df,vec_char))
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df,vec_factor))
## [1] NA
##Here, we can take the mean of a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
## We can also take the mean of logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
##We cannot take the mean of  character vector of length 10
##We can not take the mean of a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
```

**Next, convert variables from logical vector, character and factor to
numeric by using the as.numeric function. Outputs are hide as
instructed.**

``` r
as.numeric(df$gr_than_zero)
as.numeric(df$vec_char)
as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
```
