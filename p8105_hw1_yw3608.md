# Problem 1

**First, load the tidyverse library.**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

**Next, create a dataframe which satisfy the required question**

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    score=rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=1),
gr_than_zero =score > 0,
vec_char =c("Lily","Cody","Tommy","Sally","Jack","Anna","Lucy","Coco","Jerry","Stella"),
vec_factor =factor(c("high school diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","high school diploma","postgraduate diploma","postgraduate diploma","high school diploma"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##       score gr_than_zero vec_char vec_factor          
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>        <chr>    <fct>               
    ##  1  0.0762  TRUE         Lily     high school diploma 
    ##  2  0.689   TRUE         Cody     college diploma     
    ##  3 -0.546   FALSE        Tommy    college diploma     
    ##  4 -0.215   FALSE        Sally    college diploma     
    ##  5 -0.533   FALSE        Jack     college diploma     
    ##  6 -0.588   FALSE        Anna     college diploma     
    ##  7  0.0360  TRUE         Lucy     high school diploma 
    ##  8 -1.01    FALSE        Coco     postgraduate diploma
    ##  9 -0.221   FALSE        Jerry    postgraduate diploma
    ## 10  0.00494 TRUE         Stella   high school diploma

**Next, try to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe**

``` r
mean(pull(df,score))
## [1] -0.2305335
mean(pull(df,gr_than_zero))
## [1] 0.4
mean(pull(df,vec_char))
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df,vec_factor))
## [1] NA
```

``` r
#Here, we can take the mean of a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
#We can also take the mean of logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
#We cannot take the mean of  character vector of length 10
#We can not take the mean of a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”**
```

**Next, convert variables from logical vector, character and factor to
numeric by using the as.numeric function. Outputs are hide as
instructed.**

``` r
as.numeric(df$gr_than_zero)
as.numeric(df$vec_char)
as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
```

``` r
#By using as.numeric function, the logical vector changed to either 0 or 1, which means that TRUE OR FALSE. 
#The character vector still shows the warning message which can explain the warning message as 
#I tried to take the mean of it.Argument is not numeric or logical will return NA.
#The factor vector returns to 1,2 or 3, which is the 3 diffenent levels.
```
