# Problem 1

**First, load the tidyverse library.**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

**Next, create a dataframe which satisfy the required question**

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    score=rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=1),
gr_than_zero =score > 0,
vec_char =c("Lily","Cody","Tommy","Sally","Jack","Anna","Lucy","Coco","Jerry","Stella"),
vec_factor =factor(c("high school diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","college diploma","high school diploma","postgraduate diploma","postgraduate diploma","high school diploma"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##      score gr_than_zero vec_char vec_factor          
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>        <chr>    <fct>               
    ##  1 -0.184  FALSE        Lily     high school diploma 
    ##  2  0.0450 TRUE         Cody     college diploma     
    ##  3 -0.253  FALSE        Tommy    college diploma     
    ##  4 -1.10   FALSE        Sally    college diploma     
    ##  5  1.67   TRUE         Jack     college diploma     
    ##  6  0.699  TRUE         Anna     college diploma     
    ##  7 -0.413  FALSE        Lucy     high school diploma 
    ##  8  0.468  TRUE         Coco     postgraduate diploma
    ##  9  0.218  TRUE         Jerry    postgraduate diploma
    ## 10  2.10   TRUE         Stella   high school diploma

**Next, try to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe**

``` r
mean(pull(df,score))
## [1] 0.3250767
mean(pull(df,gr_than_zero))
## [1] 0.6
mean(pull(df,vec_char))
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df,vec_factor))
## [1] NA
```

``` r
#Here, we can take the mean of a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
#We can also take the mean of logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
#We cannot take the mean of  character vector of length 10
#We can not take the mean of a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”**
```

**Next, convert variables from logical vector, character and factor to
numeric by using the as.numeric function. Outputs are hide as
instructed.**

``` r
as.numeric(df$gr_than_zero)
as.numeric(df$vec_char)
as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
```

``` r
#By using as.numeric function, the logical vector changed to either 0 or 1, which means that TRUE OR FALSE. 
#The character vector still shows the warning message which can explain the warning message as 
#I tried to take the mean of it.Argument is not numeric or logical will return NA.
#The factor vector returns to 1,2 or 3, which is the 3 diffenent levels.
```

# Problem 2

**First, install the palmerpenguins packages,and write a short
description of the penguins dataset.**

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
```
